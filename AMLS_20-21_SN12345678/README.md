# README
The project folders are organized as suggested in the coursework description
Each task has its own folder with a python file in it that performes each task - there is no need to run these files separately
There is a main.py file in the main folder that imports all the python files from the sub folders for each task and runs them
main.py trains all the models using the data in the Dataset folder (that is initially empty)
main.py does all this by calling the main() function from all other python files (mainA1, mainA2, mainB1, mainB2)
These functions are in the corresponding python file in the subfolders and does all the job needed.

ONLY NEED TO RUN MAIN.PY, but be careful to put all the training and test data into the correct folders.

packeges required are : pandas, numpy, cv2, matplotlib, sklearn, keras, io, base64, tensorflow, scipy, tqdm, PIL
The whole thing takes a lot of time to run:)
